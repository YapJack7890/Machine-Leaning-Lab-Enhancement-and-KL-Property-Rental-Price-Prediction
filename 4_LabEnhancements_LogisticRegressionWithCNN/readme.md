## Overview of Lab Enhancement 4
In this lab, we will learn about the applications of the sigmoid function in logistic regression. 
This lab will also show how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use numbers to see and recognize real life objects using the concepts from calculus and statistics.
Moreover, we will then learn how to train a Convolutional Network. Last but not least, we will learn how Principal Component Analysis (PCA) works and what it does.
