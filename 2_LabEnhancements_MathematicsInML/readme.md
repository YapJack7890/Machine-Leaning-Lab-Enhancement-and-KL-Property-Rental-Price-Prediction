## Overview of Lab Enhancement 2

In the 2nd lab exercise enhancement, we will talk about mathematics and statistics in machine learning. It teaches the absolute mean error, overfitting, and underfitting. After all that, The Computer Vision with Machine learining part will teach you about image segmentation using k-means clustering. This part shows us how Machine Learning Models can be trained for computer vision.
