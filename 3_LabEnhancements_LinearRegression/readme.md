## Overview of Lab Enhancement 3

This lab will to delve deep into the mathematical inner workings of Machine Learning Algorithm. It teaches us how training a linear regression model works and how a linear regression model is validated. After that, the lab introduces neural networks and how they work. Lastly, it teaches us the concept of gradient descent.
